      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The Event Management and Live Counting System is an innovative solution created to simplify the process of
        organizing and managing events. With a strong focus on ease of use, this system is designed to address key tasks
        such as real-time tracking of attendees, participant management, and ensuring smooth coordination throughout the
        event.

        We are developing this project as part of our participation in the KIST Fair 2025, where we aim to showcase its
        practical applications and compete with other projects. The primary goal of this system is to provide event
        organizers with powerful tools to effectively manage the flow of visitors and participants, while offering
        real-time insights into event attendance, participant engagement, and operational efficiency.

        One of the unique features of this system is the ability for participants to submit issues or concerns during
        the event. These issues are then visible to volunteers, who can quickly address and resolve them, ensuring a
        smoother experience for all attendees.

        By providing these capabilities, our system helps streamline event management and improves communication between
        participants and volunteers, making the entire event process more efficient and organized.</p>
